Bioinformatics analysis is often used in genomics research and oncology research,while This project will provide some bioinformatics analysis scripts and explain how to use them

It is conceivable that you or your partner may not understand what we are offering or may not be able to find the information you are looking for, so we have compiled some useful reference sites in [a document](https://github.com/LelouchLiLucifer/Cookbook_of_Bioinformatic/blob/main/doc/some%20useful%20weblink) and provided them at the very beginning

## What does your research team need
To do bioinformatics analysis, your organization needs to spend a lot of time and money beforehand, and they need to be spent on the right things so that you don't have to spend too much time with unnecessary hassle
### Rent or buy a server running linux
Servers tend to be inexpensive. You can rent a server from Internet companies such as Alibaba and Tencent. You can learn from any video site how to choose a server. The only two things I would suggest to you are to try to choose a server that is **located in Hong Kong or Taiwan China** and make sure you have full control.
### Whole-genome-analysis file
You should have taken the full genome sequence of your subject, which should include at least **normal cells, tumor cells, and normal cells of the subject's immediate family**.Maybe someday we'll write an article that tells you how to read a document like this
### PC
If you're reading this, I'm sure you own personal computer. Your computer doesn't need expensive hardware to do genomics analysis. We don't need artificial intelligence to draw or chat! However, if your computer can work 24 hours a day without losing Internet connection, you can monitor your server's progress more easily.
### Some documents provided by the authorities
Upload some files to your server in advance and make sure everyone knows where they are.These files can be downloaded for free on some companies' websites.Make sure that the file you download is **appropriate for the research you are doing**. It doesn't matter if it is the latest version as long as you know what version it is.
